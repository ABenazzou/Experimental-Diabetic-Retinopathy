# Diabetic Retinopathy Experimental Project

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks, with each notebook exploring a different model or approach to improving diabetic retinopathy detection.

## Models Used
- **DenseNet**: This notebook explores the use of the DenseNet architecture for diabetic retinopathy classification.

- **EfficientNet (No Preprocessing)**: In this notebook, we apply EfficientNet without preprocessing to detect diabetic retinopathy.

- **Model from Scratch**: This notebook involves the creation of a custom deep learning model from scratch for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis.

- **MobileNetV2**: Here, we implement the MobileNetV2 architecture for lightweight diabetic retinopathy detection.

- **Efficient B5 with Fast Gradient Attack**: This notebook focuses on using EfficientNetB5 with fast gradient attack for enhanced robustness in diabetic retinopathy detection.

- **VGG Feature Extraction with LGBM Classifier**: In this notebook, we employ VGG for feature extraction and use an LGBM classifier for classification.

- **Xception**: This notebook explores the Xception model for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis.

## Notebooks
Each model is represented in a separate Jupyter notebook. You can find implementations in the respective notebooks.

## Data
The project uses a diabetic retinopathy dataset, which can be obtained from [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data].

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. If you have suggestions, improvements, or additional models to share, feel free to create a pull request.
